nclassifier
===========

Simple HMM to classify numbers into categories

## Building Instructions ##

You will need the ik library. Both the nclassifier and ik directories
should be at the same level in your filesystem as the nclassifier
references the parent directory to get to ik.

	git clone https://github.com/iankorf/ik.git
	cd ik
	make

Now you can go to the nclassifier and build that too.

	cd nclassifier
	make
